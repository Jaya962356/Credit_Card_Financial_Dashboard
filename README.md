<h2>Importing, Transforming, and Visualizing Data with Power BI</h2>


**Steps:**
  
**Import Data from SQL:**

Connect Power BI to your SQL database using the Get Data option.


**Data Transformation and Cleaning:**

Use the Power Query Editor in Power BI to clean and prepare your data.

Handle missing values (e.g., replace with defaults or remove rows).

Apply data type conversions (e.g., ensure numbers, dates, and text are correctly formatted).

**Load Data into Power BI:**

Once the data is cleaned and transformed, apply the changes to load the processed data into Power BI.

Save the model and validate data relationships.

**Design Visualizations:**

Use Power BI's interactive dashboard features to design and display your data insights.

Include visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs, and tables to represent key metrics.
